## ✨ Philosophy

> “Mastering the basics is the foundation for building anything great.”

This project focuses on **fundamentals** — writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured HTML and CSS.
The goal wasn’t to build a complex application, but to create a solid base for future scalability.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.
While the core structure follows their assignment, I occasionally used **AI-based tools** for syntax suggestions and to generate minor code snippets to improve workflow efficiency.
