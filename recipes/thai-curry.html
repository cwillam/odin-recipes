          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Green Curry, or Gaeng Keow Wan, is a classic Thai dish known for its creamy texture,
            complex aroma, and invigorating heat. The vibrant green color comes from the curry
            paste, which contains fresh chilies, lemongrass, and galangal.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dish is traditionally prepared with bamboo shoots, Thai basil, and kaffir lime
            leaves, and it's ready in just 30 minutes. It is the perfect, aromatic meal for anyone
            who wants a quick and authentic Asian dish. Serve it hot with jasmine rice.

              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Sauté the Paste:</strong> Heat the oil in a large pot or wok over medium
                  heat. Add the green curry paste and sauté it, stirring, for 1-2 minutes until
                  fragrant.

                  <strong>Add Coconut Milk and Meat:</strong> Add about one-third of the coconut
                  milk and stir until the paste has completely dissolved. Add the sliced chicken and

              </li>

                  <strong>Simmer:</strong> Pour in the remaining coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar,
                  and kaffir lime leaves. Bring everything to a simmer and reduce the heat.

              </li>
              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Season and Serve:</strong> Remove the curry from the heat. Take out the
                  lime leaves and stir in the Thai basil leaves. Taste and adjust the seasoning if
                  necessary (more fish sauce for salt, more sugar for sweetness). Serve immediately
                  with jasmine rice. Enjoy your meal!
