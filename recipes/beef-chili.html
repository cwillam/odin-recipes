          <p>
            This classic beef chili is the ultimate comfort food—rich, thick, and packed with
            flavor. It’s slow-simmered to perfection, allowing the spices, tomatoes, and beef to
            meld into a deeply satisfying meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perfect for a cold evening, a tailgate party, or simply serving over rice or cornbread.
            The heat level is adjustable, making it great for the whole family. It tastes even
            better the next day!

                  <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil
