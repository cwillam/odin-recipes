          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Vareniki with cherries are a classic Russian sweet dumpling, enjoyed as a dessert or a
            special summer meal. The tender dough, combined with the juicy, slightly tart cherry
            filling, creates a delightful contrast of flavors and textures.

            Often served with a dollop of sour cream (smetana) and a sprinkle of sugar, these
            dumplings are a beloved comfort food in many Eastern European households. They are
            surprisingly simple to make and are a wonderful way to enjoy fresh or frozen cherries.

              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>For the dough:</strong> 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup warm water or
                  kefir, 1 egg, and a pinch of salt.
                </div>

              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>For the filling:</strong> 4 cups pitted cherries (fresh or frozen), 1/2
                  cup sugar (or to taste), 1 tbsp cornstarch (optional, to thicken juices).

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and
                  salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg and warm water/kefir. Mix until a
                  shaggy dough forms, then transfer to a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes
                  until smooth and elastic. Cover with a bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes.

              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> If using frozen cherries, thaw them
                  slightly. In a bowl, gently toss the pitted cherries with sugar and cornstarch.
                  The cornstarch will help prevent the filling from becoming too watery.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Assemble the vareniki:</strong> On a floured surface, roll out the dough
                  thinly (about 2-3 mm). Use a glass or a round cutter to cut out circles. Place 3-4
                  cherries in the center of each dough circle.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Seal the dumplings:</strong> Fold the dough circle in half over the
                  filling to create a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges together very firmly to seal.
                  It's crucial to seal them well to prevent the cherry juice from leaking during
                  cooking.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Cook the vareniki:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
                  Carefully add the vareniki in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pot. Once
                  they float to the surface, cook for another 2-3 minutes.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div>
                  <strong>Serve:</strong> Use a slotted spoon to remove the vareniki. Toss them
                  gently in a bowl with melted butter to prevent sticking. Serve warm with a
                  generous amount of sour cream and a sprinkle of sugar. Enjoy!
